## What does this mod do?
UAL increases the ambient lighting underground very slightly, which unnoticeably increases underground visibility without impacting the usefulness of blocks such as torches!  
Use **`I`** to toggle functionality! *(changeable in the controls menu)*

This mod is completely **client-side** and will work on vanilla servers.
